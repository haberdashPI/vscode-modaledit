 - add option to store settings in a separate file
   - or do we just use the preset feature???
   - gracefully handle parser errors
   - watch the file and update settings appropriately
   - use a seperate setting, and allow it to be machine overrideable
   - allow the file to be a remote resource (e.g. a github repository)?
 - define as a new extension
 - default to theme consistent decorators for searched elements
 - Allow keybindings to be specified as multi-string values
 - allow normal model to cancel old typing state
 - allow for normal mode timeout
 - try using a hover provider to show the current count,
 - if this works use hover to show closests hits
